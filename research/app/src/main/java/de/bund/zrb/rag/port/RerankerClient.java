/**
 * Port interface for cross-encoder reranking (Stage 3 of the RAG pipeline).
 *
 * <h3>Pipeline Architecture (Google-style)</h3>
 * <pre>
 *   Stage 1   — BM25 Search:     Full-text keyword search via Lucene.
 *                                 → ~50 candidate passages
 *   Stage 2   — Embeddings:      (OPTIONAL) Semantic vector search widens the
 *                                 candidate set: "Auto" also finds "KFZ".
 *                                 When active, results are merged with BM25.
 *   Stage 3   — Reranking:       Cross-encoder scores each (query, passage) pair
 *                                 on RAW TEXT. REPLACES BM25 scoring with much
 *                                 more accurate relevance scores.
 *                                 → top 3–5 results
 *   Stage 4   — LLM Generation:  (optional) Summarize top results into an answer.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Embeddings are NOT required for reranking.</b> The reranker works on
 * raw text, not on vectors. It can rescore BM25-only candidates just fine.
 * Embeddings improve the <em>candidate pool</em> (semantic recall), but the
 * reranker independently replaces BM25 <em>scoring</em> with cross-encoder
 * relevance scores regardless of how candidates were retrieved.
 *
 * <p>In settings, Embeddings and Reranker can be toggled independently:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>BM25 only → basic keyword retrieval</li>
 *   <li>BM25 + Reranker → accurate rescoring of keyword results</li>
 *   <li>BM25 + Embeddings → hybrid recall (keyword + semantic)</li>
 *   <li>BM25 + Embeddings + Reranker → best quality (wide recall + precise scoring)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Stages 1–3 run on <b>CPU only</b>. Only Stage 4 requires GPU/cloud.
